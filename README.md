# Chat app

Chat app powered by Ruby on Rails and React with websockets.

The app was developed for me to strengthen my knowledge of Ruby on Rails and React.

## Technologies

- Ruby on Rails
- ReactJS
- PostgreSQL
- Docker

## System dependencies

### The app runs through Docker, which needs to be installed on your system.
 
The app contains 3 docker images; a PostgreSQL database image, and Vite React frontend app and a Ruby on Rails app.

Containers that are generated by the two images:

- `app.local`
- `frontend.local`
- `postgres.local`

If you wish to run `rails` commands, you can cd into `./api` and run `./bin/rails` shell script, or you can install Ruby and then install the Rails gem with `gem install rails`.

## App startup

The default Docker configuration starts the app with the `development` environment.

Rename `example.env` in the `api` and `frontend` directories to `.env` and change the values by neccessity. The app will run even the file is only renamed.

If you wish to change database connections settings, you can edit the `./api/config/database.yml` file to suit your needs.

To run the app, run `docker compose up` in project root. This will setup the database, React dev server and Rails app containers and start the app.

The React frontend is accessible on [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) by default. 

The Ruby on Rails API is accessible on [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) by default. 

The database is automatically seeded in the `development` environment. Database seeds are located in `api/db/seeds.rb`, which can be changed by need. 

The default seeds create some default users:
- A user with email: `test@test.com`, password: `password`
- 7 more users with logins: `test<index>@test.com`, password: `password` (change `<index>` with a number from 0 to 6)

The seeds also create some:
- chatrooms
- channels
- messages

## Features

- [x] User authentication
- [x] Message CRUD functionality with websockets which broadcast on message updates
